## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive guide and reference for solving DSA problems using Java. The solutions include step-by-step explanations and are structured for readability and scalability.

---

## Features

- **Clean and Modular Code**: Each algorithm and data structure is implemented in its separate class.
- **Commented Code**: All implementations include comments for better understanding.
- **Example Test Cases**: Each implementation includes sample test cases for quick verification.
- **Focus on Efficiency**: Includes time and space complexity analysis for each algorithm.
